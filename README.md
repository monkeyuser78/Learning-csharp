## About Me
Hi! I'm learning C# and using this repository to track my progress. 

## What Is This Repository?
This repository contains C# projects, and code snippets that I create while learning the language. It’s a place for me to experiment and improve.

## What It's About
The goal of this repository is to help me learn C# by building small projects and experimenting with different concepts. It's also a way to track my progress and share what I’ve learned with others!
